        <h1>Odhissi</h1>
            <p id="dance-info"  >
                Odissi,also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major
                ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples
                of Odisha â€“ an eastern coastal state of India.Odissi, in its history,
                was performed predominantly by women,and expressed religious stories
                and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath).
                Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such
                as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu
                goddesses (Shaktism).

            <p id="dance">
                Odissi is traditionally a dance-drama genre of performance art,
                where the artist(s) and musicians play out a mythical story, a 
                spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts, using 
                symbolic costumes, body movement, abhinaya (expressions) and 
                mudras (gestures and sign language) set out in ancient Sanskrit
                literature.Classical Odia literature & the Gitagovinda set to traditional
                Odissi music are used for the abhinaya. Odissi is learnt and performed 
                as a composite of basic dance motif called the Bhangas (symmetric body bends,
                stance). It involves lower (footwork), mid (torso) and upper (hand and head) 
                as three sources of perfecting expression and audience engagement with geometric
                symmetry and rhythmic musical resonance.An Odissi performance repertoire includes
                invocation, nritta (pure dance), nritya (expressive dance), natya (dance drama) 
                and moksha (dance climax connoting freedom of the soul and spiritual release).
