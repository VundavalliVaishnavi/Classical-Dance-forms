        <h1>Sattriya</h1>
            <p id="dance-info"  >
                Sattriya , or Sattriya Nritya, is a major Indian classical dance.
                It is a dance-drama performance art with origins in the Krishna-centered
                Vaishnavism monasteries of Assam, and attributed to the 15th century Bhakti
                movement scholar and saint Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardev.

            <p id="dance">
                Sattriya Nritya is a genre of dance drama that tells mythical and 
                religious stories through hand and face expressions. The basic dance 
                unit and exercise of a Sattriya is called a Mati Akhara, equal 64 just
                like in Natya Shastra, are the foundational sets dancers learn during 
                their training. The Akharas are subdivided into Ora, Saata, Jhalak, 
                Sitika, Pak, Jap, Lon and Khar. A performance integrates two styles, 
                one masculine (Paurashik Bhangi, energetic and with jumps), and 
                feminine (Stri Bhangi, Lasya or delicate).Traditionally, Sattriya was
                performed only by bhokots (male monks) in monasteries as a part of their 
                daily rituals or to mark special festivals. Today, in addition to this 
                practice, Sattriya is also performed on stage by men and women who are 
                not members of the sattras, on themes not merely mythological.<br>
                <br>
                The plays choreographed in a Sattriya are those found in Hindu texts 
                such as the Bhagavata Purana, the Epics, and the compositions by Assamese
                scholars. The stories related to the love between Radha and Krishna are 
                particularly common.
