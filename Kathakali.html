                Kathakali is a major form of classical Indian dance.
                It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by 
                the elaborately colorful make-up, costumes and face masks that 
                the traditionally male actor-dancers wear.Kathakali is a Hindu 
                performance art in the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of
                India (Kerala).

                Kathakalī's roots are unclear.
                A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes
                music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together
                to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates 
                movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South
                India.Kathakalī also differs in that the structure and details of its art 
                form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike
                other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples 
                and monastic schools.The traditional themes of the Kathakalī are folk mythologies,
                religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas.
                The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in Sanskritised Malayalam.
                In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women artists,
                as well as adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare.s
